pride flags in the terminal!

## Usage

```sh
pride <flag> [width height]
```

## Known issues

The flags will show up differently depending on your terminals color settings, this results in some flags not looking very good on some terminals.

The gay pride flag looks horrid everywhere, please, help me.

## Add more!

Feel free to add more flags, add a pull request if you like, or open an issue if you want me to add another flag!
